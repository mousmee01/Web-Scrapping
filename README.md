# Web-Scrapping
The project focused on two main aspects, which are qualitative outlook and an analytical one, respectively. The former discusses why Currys should focus on improving its current webpage rather than launching a new mobile application by performing financial statement analyses for Currys and related competitors and cost analysis of launching an app. The latter is focused more on analysing how to better utilize Currys’ resources. This is performed by investigating the marketing channel, data provided by Currys, and sentiment analysis of current customers on social media. We emphasized on three investment channels for Currys namely, PWA (Progressive Web Application) improvement, Social CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Customer Service. Finally, we used an auditing tool called Lighthouse to perform an audit for the company’s PWA and compared it with their competitor’s PWAs.
